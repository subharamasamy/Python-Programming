Python 3.7.2

Two modes to execute program:
1)interactive mode programming
    #directly executing in terminal and get output in terminal itself
2)Script mode programming
   #create a program in notepad. execute that notepad in terminal to get output alone in terminal
   
 Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.
 
 Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

>>> print ("hello,python")
hello,python


Lines and indentation:

print ("hai")
a=10;
b=20;
if (a>b):
	print ("true")
else:
	print ("false")


Quotation in python:

Python supports single , double and triple quotes.
' '  ,  "  " , """ """   or  '''  '''


single = 'hello';
double = "execute the python program"
triple = """ The way Python scripts are run on Windows versus Unix based operating ... Run a Python script under Windows with the Command Prompt."""

print (single);
print (double);
print (triple);



To get input from user:

print("Enter your name:")
a=input()
print (a);

Variables: 
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Variable types or data types:

Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. 
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

Multiple Assignements:
>>> a=b=c=2;
>>> print (a);
2
>>> print (b);
2
>>> print (c);
2
>>>


>>> a,b,c=1,2,3;
>>> print(a,b,c);
1 2 3

To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:
>>> a="hello";
>>> print ("hai"+a);
haihello


Python has five standard data types âˆ’
Numbers
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary


Numbers:
it stores numeric value.
a=10;

Able to delete the variables using del statement:
>>> a=20;
>>> print(a)
20
>>> del a;
>>> print(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined

Strings:
Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string 
The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

>>> test="hai world"
>>> print(test)
hai world
>>> print(test[1]) //print 2nd character
a
>>> print(test[0]) //print 1st character
h
>>> print(test[2]) //print 3rd character
i
>>> print(test[3])

>>> print(test[4])
w
>>> print(test[5])
o
>>> print(test[6])
r
>>> print(test[7])
l
>>> print(test[8])
d
>>> print(test[9])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
>>>
>>> print(test[1:8])   ////prints from 2nd to 8th character
ai worl
>>> print(test[1:9])
ai world
>>> print(test[2:9])
i world
>>> print(test[0:9])
hai world
>>> print(test[0:8])
hai worl
>>> print(test[0:5])
hai w
>>> print(test[0:6])
hai wo
>>> print(test[0:7])
hai wor


>>> check = "hello";
>>> print (check);
hello
>>> print (check *2);
hellohello
>>> print (check *3);
hellohellohello
>>> print (check *0);

>>> print (check *5);
hellohellohellohellohello

>>> check1 = "hai"
>>> print(check1)
hai

//////incorrect format
>>> print(check1 + hello + python)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'hello' is not defined

/////////correct format
>>> print(check1 + "hello" + "python")
haihellopython
>>> print(check1 + "hello")
haihello


strip() method:
it removes whitespaces from beginning or end of the string.
>>> check="      hey      "
>>> print(check)
      hey
>>> print(check.strip())
hey
>>>


len() method:
it returns the length of a string
>>> length="checking python"
>>> print(len(length))
15


lower() method:
it returns the string in lower case
>>> case="HELLO PYTHON"
>>> print(case.lower())
hello python
>>> case1="HeLLo pYTHoN"
>>> print(case1.lower())
hello python


upper() method:
it returns the string in upper case
>>> case="hello python"
>>> print(case.upper())
HELLO PYTHON
>>> case1="heLLO pYThon"
>>> print(case1.upper())
HELLO PYTHON

Combination of upper and lower case:
>>> case1="heLLO pYThon"
>>> print(case1[6:].upper())
PYTHON
>>> print(case1[6:].upper()+case1[0:5].lower())
PYTHONhello
>>> print(case1[6:].upper()+case1[0:4].lower())
PYTHONhell


replace() method:
Replaces a string with another string
>>> change="hey pythonnn"
>>> print(change.replace('n','t'))
hey pythottt


split() method:
Splits the string into substrings
>>> spl="hai,hello"
>>> print(spl.split(","))
['hai', 'hello']


Loops:
Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Eg:
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands:
while loops
for loops

The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true

The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

Looping through a string:
for a in "Vesta":
	print(a)

o/p:
V
e
s
t
a

The Range() Function:

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default

for a in range(5):
	print(a)

for b in range(2,6):
	print(b)

for c in range(10,20,2):
	print(c)

o/p:
0
1
2
3
4

2
3
4
5

10
12
14
16
18


Example:
1. Print odd number and even number
2. Print Prime number


for even in range(0,50,2):
	print("Even number is",even);
for odd in range(1,50,2):
	print("Odd number is" , odd);
