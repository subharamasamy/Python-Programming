Python 3.7.2

Two modes to execute program:
1)interactive mode programming
    #directly executing in terminal and get output in terminal itself
2)Script mode programming
   #create a program in notepad. execute that notepad in terminal to get output alone in terminal
   
 Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.
 
 Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

>>> print ("hello,python")
hello,python


Lines and indentation:

print ("hai")
a=10;
b=20;
if (a>b):
	print ("true")
else:
	print ("false")


Quotation in python:

Python supports single , double and triple quotes.
' '  ,  "  " , """ """   or  '''  '''


single = 'hello';
double = "execute the python program"
triple = """ The way Python scripts are run on Windows versus Unix based operating ... Run a Python script under Windows with the Command Prompt."""

print (single);
print (double);
print (triple);
